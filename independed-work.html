      Are you a blogger lost for words? Seems like a strange position to be in,
      but most writers find themselves stumped when asked to describe
      themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      An ‘About Me’ (or <a href="https://t.me/portfolio_byjoseph1406" target="_blank"> ‘About Us‘</a>) page on your blog is an opportunity to let
      your readers find out more about you, so the importance of writing a good
      page shouldn’t be overlooked, even if the thought of blowing your own
      trumpet makes you cringe a little. It’s also likely to be one of your most
      visited pages, especially for new readers or marketers who want to find
      out more about you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are a few of the main points to remember when you’re crafting your
      online profile.
    </p>

    <p><b> Let Your Readers See Who You Are</b></p>

    <p>
      An essential element of your ‘about me’ page should be a photo. While you
      may want to be better known for your words than your face, your readers
      will still want to see the person behind the words.
    </p>

    <p>
      People instantly relate to faces – while they may enjoy and engage with
      your writing, your face will create an instant connection. Most
      importantly, your readers can see that you’re a real person. Too shy for a
      photo? Illustrations and caricatures can also work well,
      as <a href="https://t.me/portfolio_byjoseph1406" target="_blank"> Carrie </a> demonstrates.
    </p>

    <p><b>Include the Basics</b></p>

    <p>
      It may sound obvious but your ‘about me’ page needs to convey some basic
      information about you. You should include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Where you’re based – great for fans and useful for PRs</li>
      <li>
        A way to get in touch, like an email address –  without one, your blog
        is just a one-way conversation
      </li>
      <li>
        Include a name – it doesn’t matter whether it’s your full name, first
        name or even a nickname, so long as there is an identity that people can
        use if they want to contact you
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>How to get the Ideas Flowing</b></p>

    <p>
      Start a first draft and push through that ‘cringe’ feeling by going as
      over the top as possible. Just get some ideas down and don’t worry if it
      sounds arrogant. The first draft can give you something to work with; you
      can refine and tone down your writing later on. Plus, by going overboard,
      you’re next draft is likely to seem much less cringe-worthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another tactic to get the words flowing is to pretend you’re someone else
      who’s writing about you. Distancing yourself mentally from your own life
      and achievements should help you write honestly and passionately about who
      you are and what you do.
    </p>

    <p><b>Sell Yourself (because no one else will)</b></p>

    <p>
      What you’ve got to remember when you’re writing your ‘about me’ page is
      that people have clicked on this page because they want to find out more –
      so tell them!
    </p>

    <p>
      Unless you show the best of your achievements and personal attributes, no
      one will know. Think of it like writing a CV – a potential employer can
      only work with what you tell them about yourself. A list of brands you’ve
      worked with, blogging awards you’ve won or been shortlisted for and
      publications you’ve appeared in could all be featured on an ‘about me’
      page.
    </p>

    <p><b>Talk to your Readers and tell them a Story</b></p>

    <p>
      Surprisingly, your ‘about me’ page is not just about you. If you think
      about it, it makes sense – you’re not writing this for yourself but for
      your readers. Think about your audience and talk to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      To achieve this, keep your tone conversational and write in first person.
      One of the best ways to engage with people is to tell a story. And by
      story, we don’t mean your life story. Take something from life your life
      and make it into a story which sums up who you are and what you’re about.
      Choose something that was a turning point in your career or personal life,
      which makes you who you are, or is the reason you started blogging
      – Belleau <a href="https://t.me/portfolio_byjoseph1406" target="_blank"> Kitchen </a> does this really well.
    </p>

    <p><b>Be Yourself</b></p>

    <p>
      Writing an ‘about me’ page is very similar to writing an online dating
      profile and the same advice applies to both – be yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important to consider what you want to achieve with your blog because
      an authentic profile can help you get to where you want to be. By being
      yourself, you can attract the right readers and right opportunities.
      Copying someone else’s page or pretending to be something that you’re not
      will only give you unsuitable opportunities. Just like in dating, you’re
      looking to attract the people right for you.
    </p>

    <p><b>Give your Readers an Opportunity to get Involved</b></p>

    <p>
      Lastly, you should aim to finish your ‘about me’ page with a call to
      action of some kind. Whether this is your email address, a link to your
      social media profiles or your newsletter, you should use the opportunity
      to explain how your readers can get more involved with your blog.
      Hopefully this guide has helped you start the tricky task of writing about
      yourself. While you still may hate the experience, this guide should make
      the process a little easier. If you want to read some good example, check
